# Hotspotting - Our Last Mile Delivery System

This is a project developed during the [ŠKODA Smart Mobility Hackathon 2019](https://www.ceehacks.com/smhprague2019/) held at [ŠKODA AUTO DigiLab, Prague](https://skodaautodigilab.com/). 

We took on the challenge of Effective Delivery.
Based on a set of data about deliveries collected from more than 500.000 delivery rides, we have to find the best possible route planning and effective use of resources available. 

We created an algorithm that finds bottlenecks based on the data provided from [DoDo](https://idodo.cz/en/for-partners-2/), a Czech Republic delivery company to discover cases of the low driver and car utilization.

### How it works


### Prerequisites



### Libraries and APIs used

- Pandas for data manipulation and extraction
- Requests for API calls 
- Glob for iteration of data files (in csv)
- HERE REST API for Route Planning
